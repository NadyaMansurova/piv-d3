This is a frontend part of the programm for calculations in my PhD in MPEI.

My steps:
<ol>
  <li>Create frontend part structure +</li>
  <li>Add d3.js to frontend +</li>
  <li>Construct json data file for vectors +</li>
  <li>Using d3.js and json data file create field of vectors+</li>
  <li>Add backend part of calculation (?) references</li>
  <li>Tests programm using test data</li>
  <li>*optional. Add scale change (change size and details of field)</li>
</ol>


Using. This is a programm for the visualization of fluid flow through the images of the particles. In my work I make a model and create vector field of blood and lymph flow in human body, if vessels are healthy and if there are a problems with vessels. The main advantage of this program is the ability to perform calculations without installing additional software to the doctor computer. All calculations can be performed on a remote server, doctor should only open browser and upload photos.
