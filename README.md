piv-d3
======

This is a programm for my PhD in MPEI.

My steps:
1) Create frontend part structure +
2) Add d3.js to frontend +
3) Construct json data file for vectors +
4) Using d3.js and json data file create field of vectors
5) Construct math-calculate to create vector field from illumination matrix 
6) Construct json file from illumination matrix
7) Tests programm using test data
8) *optional. Add scale change (change size and details of field)


Using. This programm can used for the visualization of fluid flow through the images of the particles. In my work I make a model and create vector field of blood and lymph flow in human body, if vessels are healthy and if there are a problems with vessels. The main advantage of this program is the ability to perform calculations without installing additional software to the doctor computer. All calculations can be performed on a remote server, doctor should only open browser and input illumination matrix  data.
